After following the gromacs commands on the tutorials, I could save my data points and trajectories as xtc files. I went onto Jupyter and used Python packages like Matplotlib and Numpy to be able to plot these data. All of them were plotted at Eqilibration points to prove a stable box for our protein. The data was compared with a 10ps average for density and pressure figures to see how stable and accurate our system is. We can see fluctations in data points throughout the figures showing how many different states are being considered simultaneously. We also see that potential energy decreases over time while energy maximization remains the same.
