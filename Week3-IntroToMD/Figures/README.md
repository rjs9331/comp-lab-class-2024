After following the gromacs commands on the tutorials I was able to save my data points and trajectories as xtc files. I went onto jupitor and use python packages like matplotlib and numpy to be able to plot these data. All of them were plotted at Eqilibration points to prove a stable box for our protein. For density and pressure figures the data was compared with a 10ps average to see how stable and accurate our system is. We can see fluctations in data points throughout the different figures showing how many different states are being considered at the same time. We also see that potential energy decreases over time while energy maximization remains the same.
