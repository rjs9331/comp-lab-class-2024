I followed the tutorial on mdtutorials, where  gmx_mpi commands  and gromacs directory are used to get outputs for trajectories and data points of the equilbration of the protein after water is removed and ions are added. After getting the topology(information about the composition of the protein), next was forming the box and removing water molecules to have a stable environment for the protein. Then was the addition of ions to show interactions between residues and ions. Then the energy minimization and potential energy overtime was recorded and equilibration was calculated and leading to the release of xtc, gro, and other files to support and graph the data.
