I followed the tutorial on mdtutorials where is used gmx_mpi commands and gromacs directory to get outputs for trajectories and data points of the equilbration of the protein after water and ions are removed. After getting the topology(information about the composition of the protein), next was forming the box and removng water molecules to have a stable enviromn,ent for the protein. Then was the addition of ions to show interactions btween residues and ions. Then the energy minimzation and potenual energy overtime was recored and equilobration was calculuted and leading to the release of xtc,gro, and pother files to support and graph the data.
