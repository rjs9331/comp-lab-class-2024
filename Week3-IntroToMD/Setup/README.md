The setup shows how I calibrated my mdp settings to get specific data points within range to be later plotted and compared. Additionally,  energy minimizations and average speed at 10ps were completed through calculations and data calibrations. Additionally, my sbatch slurm is shown so it can be seen how I set up my batch job to meet the specific times, nodes, and memory in the instructions to get desired results.
